* GameVault Smart Contract

  This document provides technical details for the GameVault smart contract written in Solidity.

** Contract Version

  - Solidity Version: 0.8.19

** External Dependencies

  The contract relies on external dependencies from the OpenZeppelin library:

  - [@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol)
  - [@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/UUPSUpgradeable.sol)
  - [@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20Upgradeable.sol)
  - [@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol)

** Contract Definition

  This contract is named "GameVault" and it inherits from the following OpenZeppelin modules:

  - Initializable
  - UUPSUpgradeable
  - AccessControlUpgradeable

  The contract also uses the SafeERC20Upgradeable library for safe token operations.

** State Variables

  - `tether`: An IERC20Upgradeable interface representing the Tether token contract.
  - `challengeReward`: A uint256 variable representing the challenge reward amount.
  - `playersBalance`: A mapping that stores the balance of each player's rewards.

** Events

  - `ChallengeReward(uint256 challengeReward)`: Emitted when the challenge reward is set.
  - `ClaimReward(address player, uint256 amount)`: Emitted when a player claims their reward.

** Structs

  - `PlayerInfo`: A struct that includes the following details about a player:

    - `player`: Address of the player.
    - `coefficient`: A 32-bit unsigned integer representing a coefficient for reward calculation.

** Constructor

  - `initialize(address _tether, address _owner)`: Initializes the contract with the Tether token address and the contract owner. It sets the default admin role to the contract owner.

  - **Return**: No explicit return value. This function is used to set initial contract state.

** External Functions

  - `playersReward(PlayerInfo[] calldata _playerSet)`: Allows the contract owner (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) to distribute rewards to players based on their coefficients.

  - **Return**: No explicit return value. This function updates the `playersBalance` mapping for multiple players based on the provided `_playerSet`.

  - `setChallengeReward(uint256 _challengeReward)`: Allows the contract owner to set the challenge reward amount.

  - **Return**: No explicit return value. This function sets the `challengeReward` state variable to the provided `_challengeReward`.

  - `claimReward()`: Allows players to claim their rewards if they have a positive balance and sufficient tokens are available in the contract.

  - **Return**: No explicit return value. This function transfers rewards to the caller and updates the `playersBalance` mapping.

** Internal Functions

  - `_authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation)`: Overrides the UUPSUpgradeable function to ensure only the contract owner (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) can authorize an upgrade.

  - **Return**: No explicit return value. This function ensures that only the contract owner (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) can authorize an upgrade by overriding the UUPSUpgradeable function.

This documentation provides an overview of the GameVault smart contract and its key components, including the detailed structure of the `PlayerInfo` struct. Please refer to the contract's source code for more detailed implementation details and comments.
